{"level":"warn","time":"2026-02-08T04:57:41.161Z","name":"Mastra","msg":"If you are using a custom instrumentation file or want to disable this warning, set the globalThis.___MASTRA_TELEMETRY___ variable to true in your instrumentation file."}
(node:75) Warning: SECURITY WARNING: The SSL modes 'prefer', 'require', and 'verify-ca' are treated as aliases for 'verify-full'.
In the next major version (pg-connection-string v3.0.0 and pg v9.0.0), these modes will adopt standard libpq semantics, which have weaker security guarantees.
To prepare for this change:
- If you want the current behavior, explicitly use 'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq compatibility now, use 'uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require'
See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for libpq SSL mode definitions.
